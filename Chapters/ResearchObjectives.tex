\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify a means of initializing a Kubernetes cluster which can recover in the event of node failure to any node.
\item Investigate how Kubernetes can apply updates to its underlying nodes with zero downtime to the workloads it is running or to its own components.
\item Investigate the addition of a custom API to Kubernetes for the creation and querying of custom resources necessary to define the state for objectives 1 and 2.
